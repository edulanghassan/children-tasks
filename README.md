# Children's Tasks Project

## Description

The Children's Tasks Project is a web-based application designed to help engage children in various fun, educational, and creative activities. The project features a main page with a variety of task categories, each represented by interactive cards. Each card leads to a detailed page with specific tasks, providing an enriching experience for children.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Cards:** Each card on the main page represents a different category of tasks, such as Creativity and Entertainment, Learning, Physical Activities, and Household Tasks.
- **Detailed Task Pages:** Clicking on a card takes the user to a dedicated page with a list of tasks in that category.
- **Engaging Content:** Tasks are designed to be fun, educational, and appropriate for children.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:
1. **`index.html`** - The main homepage displaying all task categories.
2. **`tasks.json`** - A JSON file containing the data for various task categories.
3. **Category Pages:** Individual HTML pages for each task category (e.g., `creativity-tasks.html`, `learning-tasks.html`, etc.).
4. **CSS Files:** Stylesheets for customizing the appearance of the site.
5. **Images:** Visuals associated with each task category.
